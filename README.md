# Surfs_Up_Challenge

## Background
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Analysis

- The average temperature between June and December are very close, staying consistent within 70-74 degrees
- Max temperature between June and December are very similar 
- The lowest overall tempeture occurs in December with 56 degrees

Based on the data W. Avy would have a sustainable weather pattern to keep an ice cream shop open in Oahu. From our analysis we are able to interprite there is a 8 degree window for the lowest tempeture days and a 3 degress window for the highest days, however the majority of the data is reflected in higher degree days.
